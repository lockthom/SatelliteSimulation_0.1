Use of this repository on a local machine will require readjustments for the library and include paths for the system. It is tedious, but it is the simpest way that I - a beginner in openGL - can make this project reasonably work on my laptop and my desktop and have some degree of usability on third-party machines. This functionality will only work on Windows systems.
